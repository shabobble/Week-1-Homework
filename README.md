# Week-1-Homework

First week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

The goal of this project was to refactor the code of an existing SEO company's website to improve its accessibility. Our four main tasks were to ensure that:

* Semantic HTML elements were used to replace non-semantic HTML elements wherever possible

* All elements on the page follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* All images have accessible alt attributes

* The page has a concise, descriptive title

## Built With
