# Week-1-Homework

First week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code of an existing SEO company's website to improve its accessibility. Our four main tasks were to ensure that:

* Semantic HTML elements were used to replace non-semantic HTML elements wherever possible

* All elements on the page follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* All images have accessible alt attributes

* The page has a concise, descriptive title
